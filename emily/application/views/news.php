              HLL's R&D division introduced 'Emily', a new Intra Uterine hormonal System (IUS) for effective management of Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB) in Bengaluru on October18, 2012
          </p>
          <p>DUB affects 22 to 30% of women and accounts for 12% of gynaecological referrals. Within five years of referral, 20% of women undergo hysterectomy, making it is the most common major gynaecological operation. â€˜Emily' works as a contraceptive option and also effectively treats heavy and painful menstrual bleeding. The device is removable and releases the hormone in a controlled way for a period of five years to offer therapeutic action for contraception and against heavy menstrual bleeding. The action of this device is reversible after removal, allowing the user to become pregnant again.</p>
				<p>The last four decades have seen HLL network with various scientific and academic institutions of excellence for developing novel healthcare products. HLL has a state-of-the-art R&D centre at Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, India.</p>
