                <p><strong>HLL strives for excellence in  innovation.</strong></p>
	  			<p>Through the interchange of creative, imaginative people, a global Research and Development (R&D) centre that encourages collaboration and cooperation among highly reputed research centers in the country; and a strong commitment to ongoing investment, we have put R&D at the centre of everything we do.</p>
				<p>From Blood Transfusion Bags to Hydrocephalus Shunts, once-a-week Non Steroidal Oral Contraceptive Pills and several variants of condoms, every product from HLL is a result of innovation.</p>
				<p>The last four decades have seen HLL network with various scientific and academic institutions of excellence for developing novel healthcare products. HLL has a state-of-the-art R&D centre at Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, India.</p>
                <p><strong>R & D Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala</strong></p>
	  			<p>HLL's R&D centre has several projects in hand, carried out in-house or on collaborative mode, with premier academic and research institutions in the country and abroad. These projects cover a wide area of research ranging from development of novel techniques for drug delivery to blood filters, novel contraceptives and cancer-care devices. Some of the institutions HLL has networked with are-Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur; Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Lucknow; Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences & Technology (SCTIMST), Thiruvananthapuram; Regional Cancer Centre (RCC), Thiruvananthapuram, and Population Council, USA.</p>
				<p>HLL has set up a Technology Business Incubation centre (TBlC) at Rajiv Gandhi centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), Thiruvananthapuram. The goal of the TBlC is to develop novel, fast and easy-to-use diagnostic methodologies for various infectious diseases. As part of this collaboration, HLL has developed a duplex kit for viral infections. This project would be extended to development of newer and less expensive diagnostic kits.</p>
				<p>Based on its technological competency, the R&D centre is implementing sponsored projects from organisations including Department of Science and Technology (DST), Defense Research Development Organisation (DRDO), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Council of Scientific Industrial Research (CSIR) and international agencies like Bill& Melinda Gates Foundation.</p><a href="http://www.lifecarehll.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/hllmore.jpg"></a>
