Therefore there is little or no bleeding, as happens during a usual menstrual period. But, when the system is removed, periods should return to normal. Menstruation disappearance does not necessarily mean you have reached menopause or are pregnant. If, however, you are having regular menstrual periods and then do not have one for 6 weeks or longer, it is possible that you may be pregnant. You should consult with your doctor.

                <p><strong>7. Are there any potential serious complications and any side effects with Emily?</strong></p>
                <div class="margleft">
                    <p>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Some IUD users get a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease. PID is usually sexually transmitted. You have a higher chance of getting PID if you or your partner has sex with other partners. PID can cause serious problems such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic pain that does not go away. PID is usually treated with antibiotics. More serious cases of PID may require surgery. A hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is sometimes needed. In rare cases, infections that start as PID can even cause death.</p>
                    <p>Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these signs of PID: long-lasting or heavy bleeding, unusual vaginal discharge, low abdominal (stomach area) pain, painful sex, chills, or fever.</p>
                    <p><i><u>Embedment</u></i>&nbsp;: Emily may become attached to the uterine wall. This is called embedment. If embedment happens, Emily may no longer prevent pregnancy and you may need surgery to have it removed.</p>
                    <p><i><u>Perforation</u></i>&nbsp;: Emily may go through the uterus. This is called perforation. If your uterus is perforated, Emily may no longer prevent pregnancy. It may move outside the uterus and can cause internal Scarring, infection, or damage to other organs, and you may need surgery to have Emily removed.</p>
